  <!--
  Note:
  This svg is never to be seen as the host element itself is display:none.
  Its only purpose is to provide a context in which the angular compiler does not complain about a path element
  which is defined in the template below to be projected to the flow-path-host.

  <ng-template #pathTemplate>
    <path [attr.d]="path()"></path>
  </ng-template>
